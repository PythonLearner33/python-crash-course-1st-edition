from pizzas.models import Pizza # Import model
for pizza in Pizza.objects.all(): # Get all pizza names
    print(f'Pizza: {pizza}') # Print pizza name
    pizza_object = Pizza.objects.get(id=pizza.id) # Get Pizza object
    topping_object = pizza_object.topping_set.all() # Get topping set of individual pizza object
    for topping in topping_object: # Get individual strings of toppings
        print(topping) # Print topping
    print('\n')

I used this above to print my Pizza and Ingredients. hopefully it isn't too bad, i didn't read the documentation.

from pizzas.models import Pizza # Import model
for pizza in Pizza.objects.all(): # Get all pizza objects
    print(f'Pizza: {pizza}') # Print pizza name
    toppings = pizza.topping_set.all() # Get topping set of individual pizza object
    for topping in toppings: # Get all individual toppings for current pizza
        print(topping) # Print topping
    print('\n')

second version is better
